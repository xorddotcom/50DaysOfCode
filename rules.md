## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 50 days.*

#### Start Date
June 25th, 2016. [PUT YOUR DATE HERE]

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #50DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress. Add your solve problem code in the day folder.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
5. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
